# SoftDevChallenges
These are fun exercises proposed by the Professor Balzarotti to aid the understanding of different topics in the course Software Developement (AY 2018-19) at EURECOM
# Structure
Each challenge contains a `README` file with the scope and objective, alongside with a simple example and some files to test and verify your solution on trivial case.
Three topics are treated:
* Shell scripting
* Python scripting
* Developement/Makefiles
For each argument there are three challenges with an increasing amount in difficulty
