       -----------====== CHALLENGE ======-----------

Your goal is to check the authentication log to spot attempts to login into
your machine (over ssh) by bruteforcing the password. Any internet-facing
machine routinely receives many of such attempts, which are typically
harmless... unless a user has a very simple password, of course :)

In this folder you find a very short snippet of a real auth log file.
To achieve your objective, you want to write e command that identifies
IP addresses from which you received at least one correct login and a
number of failed login attempts greater than the number of successful ones.
The output should contain, for each row, the IP, the number of failed
attempts, and the number of successful one.

For instance, if your command is in solution.sh, the command:
> cat auth.log | bash solution.sh 

should print:

151.62.163.222 3 1
10.0.0.202 19 2

         -----------====== SUBMISSION ======-----------

Submit a text file containing in the first line your command
as you would write it on the shell. Your command will be tested invoking:

> cat logfile | bash yourfile
