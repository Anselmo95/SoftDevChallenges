       -----------====== CHALLENGE ======-----------

// This assignment is very similar to shell2 (so you can see the
// difference when you solve it in python) but the expected output is DIFFERENT!

Your goal is to check the authentication log to spot attempts to login into
your machine (over ssh) by bruteforcing the password. Any internet-facing
machine routinely receives many of such attempts, which are typically
harmless... unless a user has a very simple password, of course :)

In this folder you find a very short snippet of a real auth log file.
To achieve your objective, you want to write e command that identifies
IP addresses from which you received at least one correct login and a
number of failed login attempts greater than the number of successful ones.
The output should contain, for each row, the following information
(formatted exactly as in this example):

> python solution.py auth.log

10.0.0.202 - 19 failed for 1 users - 2 accepted for 1 users
151.62.163.222 - 3 failed for 2 users - 1 accepted for 1 users

         -----------====== SUBMISSION ======-----------

Submit your file containing the python program, which need to receive
the name of the log file as first parameter!!
Your solution will be tested by invoking:

> python solution.py logfilename
